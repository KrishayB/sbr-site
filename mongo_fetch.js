//fetch all blog posts from mongodb, then write to json file??? which sveltekit then reads from???
//not the most elegant, but not too weird and it will work, I think.

import mongodb from 'mongodb';

//see if mongodb db connection string is set in env
if (process.env.MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING) {
    //connect to mongodb
    //
    //fetch all blog posts
    //
    //write to json file
    //
}
